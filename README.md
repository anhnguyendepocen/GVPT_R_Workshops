The following provides code for a series of political methodology workshops on using `R` which took place in the Fall 2016. The workshops focused on:
 
 - `R` Basics 
 - Data Management
 - Basic Modeling
 - Presentation
 
The workshops were tailored toward an "adept STATA user" who was looking to branch out into `R`. The goal of the workshops was to provide an underlying intuition of what is going on in the R programing environment, outline some manipulations that are endemic in political science data, give some initial intuition to modeling in R, and review some strategies for presenting results in a clear and reproducible manner. 
 
There was some overlap across workshops as not all material was covered each time, but hopefully these scripts will serve as a useful reference. Please email if there are any questions.
